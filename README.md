# algos-project

Implementing the maximum bandwidth problem solution in 3 ways:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm with the help of a heap
3. Kruskal's Algorithm

Comparing the running time between the 3 different implementations

Note: C++ Vector was not used intentionally as it was part of the course project requirements. Changes will be made to include vector as the course is now over. 

To-Do:
1. Integrate vectors in place of dynamic memory allocation for arrays
2. Better memory management wherever possible
3. Use the same heap data structure for storing the vertices as well as edges.
